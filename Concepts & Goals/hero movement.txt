Movement Speed Variables
var hSpeed
var vSpeed
var maxSpeed
var decelerate
var gravity
//just thinking ahead about possible ways for the robot to move

define input bindings
wait for key left, right, up, down, special mvmnt button
// allow for player to select key bindings

wait for input event

Left & Right
If{
	left or right pressed down
	accelerate to max hSpeed for movement type
else
	decelerity quickly to zero}

//&many more conditions for movement, each calling the appropriate speed type

Actually moving the character
set Movement Speed variables to call a function that redraws the sprite in the appropriate direction, and calls the proper animation

??How should the drawing take place?? most possible updates (keep a very close eye on all player input)
