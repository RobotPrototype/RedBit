Darkside:
	The dark side is characterized by it's coldness and darkness. There is a
	great deal of ice, poison, and mysterious&frightening creatures. The life that
	 inhabits this side is less evolved then on the light side; there are more
	 insects and reptiles, and much more of it is hostile. The impact of the
	 comet also left this area much more jagged and sharp and harsh.

	Comet Crater Alpha:
		The impact of Comet Alpha unlocked a vast subterranean sea. This sea leaked
		out 	and now is a massive sea on the surface. In the center of this sea is
		a large iceberg (the 	remnants of the comet). The iceberg rises like an out
		of place mountain in the center of 	that sea. There will be strange alien
		life on the inside of the comet (awoken by proximity 	to the planetoids heat)
		Areas of Note:
		- inside of the comet you will be able to ascend the comet via an entrance
		at the bottom of the sea.
		-large underwater landscape to explore
		-One side of this crater leads to the mountain that is a barrier to the
		lightside.
	Color Scheme:
		Purples, Dark greens, dark blues, etc
		Comet will be icy blues/whites/cyans

	Comet Crater Beta:
		Beta's impact created a massive sunken crater. It is a snowy desert.
		Many large glacial chunks of the comet remain. Unlike Alpha, comet Beta
		shattered completely upon impact.
		Areas of Note:
		-snowy caves

	ColorScheme:
		-White/grey (dirty snow)
		-purple soil below the snow

	Maze of Darkness:
		Bordering the lightside highlands will be a maze of darkness.
		It will be a difficult area to traverse, and will be the players
		first foray onto the dark-side.
	ColorScheme:
		Value scale of Black/Purple
