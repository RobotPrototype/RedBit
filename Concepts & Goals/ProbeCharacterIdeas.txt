Player Character Concepts:
	Alien bi-pedal probe. Designed as a research robot with a strong, specific
	purpose. It's crash landing disrupts that purpose. The probe's initial mission
	in the game is to self-repair. The game should be feel like a process of
	self-discovery, actualization and recovery. The robot will interface with XXXX
	technology and undergo an alchemical process that causes it to become a
	unique lifeform with self-awareness and determination. The probe will discover
	 metals to upgrade itself, as well as various bits of tech (far-flung pieces
	 of its capsule, as well as XXXX tech). As the probe rebuilds itself, it
	 begins to radiate a signal that it's creators discover (creators will attempt
	  to selfishly mine/harvest the resources of the planet). Also, via
		interactions with the "shepherds" it will become protective of the XXXX
		enclave. It will understand the life occupying the planet as the survivors
		of XXXX as well. The Creators of the Probe will have to be deterred. At end
		of game it is the custodian of the planetoid, guarding it as long as it can.

Upgrade ideas:
	Upgrades will be found either as entire bits of tech, or the probe will
	harvest metallic veins to give it raw materials to develop its own upgrades.
	These self-made upgrades will mimic the life on the planet. They will also be
	reskins of different metals (a la Varia Suit in Metroid) to indicate heat
	resistance/etc. Some of these upgrades will be arm replacements, leg
	replacements/whatever the probe should feel very modular, very like a fun robot.
